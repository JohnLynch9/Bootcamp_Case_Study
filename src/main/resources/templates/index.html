	<p>Hello and welcome to Johnny's art corner. This site hopes to allow family and friends to share art and art 
	requests for various creators. At the moment this site is scaled for personal family and friends of the creator.</p>
	<p>To begin an art request simply click on the top bar icon for "Request Art" and it will take you to the request art page. 
	Enter the text for the name of the art piece and the description and it will save your request. To see requests and change
	them if you need, click on forum.</p>
	<p>To submit and see art go to the gallery and add art via the "add art table". Enter the artist name, the Title of the work, 
	and the URL to access the piece. After you submit it will show up in the gallery with you as the submitter.</p>
